lake wobegon is mostly poor sandy soil and every spring the earth
heaves up a new crop of rock spiles of rocks ten feet high in the
corners of fields picked by generations of us monuments to our industry
our ancestors chose the place tired from their long journey sad for having 
left the motherland behind and this place reminded them of there so
they settled here forgetting that they had left there because the
land wasnt so good so the new life turned out to be a lot like the
old except the winters are worse
